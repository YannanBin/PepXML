## Installation

- Requirement

  `OS`:

  - `Windows`：Windows10 or later

  - `Linux`：Ubuntu 16.04 LTS or later

  `Python`:

  - `python==3.8`

- Download `PepXML` to your computer

```Linux
git https://github.com/YannanBin/PepXML.git
```

- Open the `dir` and install `environment.yaml` with `conda`

```Linux
cd PepXML
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

## Construct a label co-occurrence matrix and embed labels

```Linux
python Node2Vec.py --label_matrix_path datasets/label_matrix.csv --output_path generate_data/label_embeddings.csv --dimensions 100 --walk_length 80 --num_walks 10 --workers 4 --seed 42 --log_file log_file/node2vec.log
```



`K_Means.ipynb`--Read in the label embedding file `generate_data/label_embeddings.csv`. Plot the `SSE` curve of the K-Means clustering process, determine the optimal number of clusters according to the elbow method, and draw the corresponding `UMAP` visualization.



## Training and test PepXML model

To train a model for prediction, you can run:

```
python main.py
```

To evaluate the model, you can run:

```
python test.py
```
